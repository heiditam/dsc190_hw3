# Introduction

### Data

This data is from a publication by Chee et al. and describes the DNA sequence of CMV. A CMV DNA molecule has 229,354 complementary pairs of letters or base pairs. These scientists are in search of special patterns in the virusâ€™ DNA that contains instructions for its reproduction: replication. They discovered a total of 296 palindromic sequences, each of which are at least 10 pairs long.

### Objective

The goals of this report are to investigate the distribution of genes among this DNA sequence.
